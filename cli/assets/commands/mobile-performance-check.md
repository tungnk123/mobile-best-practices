description: Analyze mobile app for performance issues and optimization opportunities
---

Perform a comprehensive performance analysis of my mobile application:

1. **Identify Performance Issues**:
   - Check app startup time (cold start, warm start)
   - Analyze UI rendering performance (recompositions, frame drops)
   - Review list/grid rendering (LazyColumn, FlatList, UICollectionView)
   - Check image loading and caching
   - Review memory usage and potential leaks
   - Analyze network efficiency
   - Check battery consumption patterns

2. **Review Against Performance Best Practices**:
   - Use the mobile-best-practices skill to search performance domain
   - Check platform-specific optimization guidelines
   - Identify common anti-patterns

3. **Generate Performance Report**:
   - List all performance issues found with severity ratings
   - Provide optimization recommendations
   - Include code examples for improvements
   - Suggest profiling tools and monitoring strategies
   - Reference relevant documentation

Focus on $ARGUMENTS if provided, otherwise analyze the entire project.
